# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

#AI Tools Required:

ChatGPT

Lovable AI (optional integration for friendly reminders and notifications)

# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.


## Aim:

To design and develop a prompt-driven AI application that acts as a personalized productivity assistant capable of managing daily tasks, schedules, and wellness tips using large language model (LLM) capabilities.

## App Name:

Ticko – Your Productivity Partner

## Objective:

To create an interactive AI-based productivity buddy that helps users manage their daily routines, stay organized, and maintain wellness through conversational prompts.

## Software/Tools Used:

->Loveable AI

## Description:

The developed application, Ticko, is an AI productivity buddy that interacts with users via chat prompts. Users can:

1. Add, update, or delete tasks.

2. View the day’s tasks and schedule.

3. Receive priority-based reminders and wellness tips.

4. Interact naturally using simple text prompts.

**The interface displays two main sections:**

1. Chat with Ticko Panel: Users can type prompts such as:

-> “List my tasks for today.”

-> “Remind me to study at 4 PM.”

-> “I feel tired.” (to get motivational or wellness tips)

2. Task and Schedule Panels:

-> Display current tasks with color-coded priority tags (High, Medium).

-> Show today’s schedule with time, category, and duration.

## Algorithm / Workflow:

1. Start

2. Initialize AI chat interface (Ticko).

3. User Input: Accept user prompt (task request or wellness query).

4. Process Prompt:

-> Parse and interpret user intent using LLM.

-> Retrieve or modify relevant data (tasks/schedules).

5. Display Output:

-> Update task list dynamically.

-> Provide responses or motivational feedback.

6. User Interaction:

-> User can click checkboxes to mark tasks complete.

-> Chat continues with new requests.

7. End

## Sample Prompts:

-> “Add task: Call mom at 6 PM (high priority).”

-> “List today’s tasks.”

-> “Give me a wellness tip.”

-> “Remind me to take a walk at 5 PM.”

## Result:

A functional prompt-based AI productivity assistant was developed successfully. The application can interpret natural language prompts, manage personal tasks, display schedules, and respond with productivity or wellness advice interactively.

2. AI-based scheduling assistants

3. Educational task planners for students

4. Wellness and motivation companion

## Conclusion:

The experiment successfully demonstrates how large language models can be integrated into personalized applications to improve productivity, enhance time management, and promote user engagement through prompt-driven interactions.
